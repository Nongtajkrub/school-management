> My school management system written in C, including a server, client, database, and a simple terminal UI.

This project is a school management system written entirely in C, designed to handle essential administrative tasks for a school. It’s built with a modular architecture, dividing responsibilities across several key components:
    
| Component    | Description |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🖥️ **Server**   | Handles requests from clients, processes data, and manages database communication. |
| 💻 **Client**   | Provides a user-friendly interface for school staff to interact with the system. |
| 📦 **Database** | Stores data such as students, teachers, courses, grades, and more. |
| 🖼️ **Terminal UI** | A custom-built, lightweight terminal-based user interface for smooth interaction. |

## 🎯 Motivation

This project started as part of a school coursework assignment but quickly evolved into a **learning playground** for:

✅ Systems programming in **C**  
✅ Low-level **network communication**  
✅ Building a complete **client-server application**  
✅ Designing a simple but functional **terminal UI library**

The **terminal UI library** created for this project became its own thing and is now being **rewritten in Rust** as a standalone library: [**Termui**](https://github.com/nongtajkrub/termui).
